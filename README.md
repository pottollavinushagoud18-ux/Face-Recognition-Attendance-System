# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
A Python-based attendance system that uses face recognition to automate student attendance. The system captures face images, trains a recognition model, and marks attendance in real time—saving time, preventing proxy attendance, and generating digital attendance reports (CSV/Excel). Built using OpenCV, LBPH, Haar Cascade, Tkinter, and Python 3.8.
